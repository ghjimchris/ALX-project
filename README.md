# ALX PROJECT - Hospital Records Management System

# Project Name:
 - HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 
# Introduction:
Records or Data keeping in the remote parts of the country (Ghana) is a huge problem that we face as a country. The way such entities in these areas keep records/data is either the old fashioned way - papers and books stored on a shelf, or they don’t keep them at all. 

Our inspiration came from the fact that we can use our skills acquired with ALX’s SE program to help solve this problem and we wanted to start from our health sector because we feel it is the area with which we can make the most impact as young and passionate developers.
